Back in 2008, on a quest for a fuel efficient SUV, I installed a Cummins B3.3 turbo diesel engine into a 2nd generation Ford Explorer. This page will eventually contain all the documentation I have from the project, for posterity, and maybe to inspire similar projects like the ones that inspired me. It's a work in progress, so please be patient as I get things put together.
