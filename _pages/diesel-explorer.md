Back in 2008, on a quest for a fuel efficient SUV, I installed a Cummins B3.3
turbo diesel engine into a 2nd generation Ford Explorer. This page will
eventually contain all the documentation I have from the project, for posterity,
and maybe to inspire similar projects like the ones that inspired me. It's a
work in progress, so please be patient as I get things put together.

There are many people without whom this project would have never been finished,
including my family, Ed Chartier, Jon Hatch, Chris and Corey Cabral, Bryan
Blair, Jim Fillion, and probably more that I have forgotten (sorry!).
