title: Improving IPython Notebook integration with Windows

By default, the awesomely useful and fun [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) does not integrate with Windows so seamlessly. A console and then the notebook server must be opened in the proper directory in order to open a new or existing notebook. These extra steps make the IPython Notebook slightly less ideal for quickly jotting down ideasâ€”one of its greatest uses!

Not to fear, however, as the Windows Registry can easily be modified to

  1. Open notebooks directly from Windows Explorer.
  2. Create a shortcut to launch the IPython Notebook server within the current directory.

Simply download and run [ipython.reg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwMVIAlxIxfZVEZoUGpRVWdTTmM/edit?usp=sharing) to add the entries shown below to your registry automatically.

These entries were put together from instructions located [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/107965/how-to-add-any-application-shortcut-to-windows-explorers-context-menu/). A similar solution can also be found [here](http://cyrille.rossant.net/start-an-ipython-notebook-server-in-windows-explorer/).

```bat
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\ipynb]
@="Open IPython Notebook server here"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\ipynb\command]
@="\"C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\ipython.exe\" \"notebook\" \"%V\""

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\ipynb]
@="Open IPython Notebook server here"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\ipynb\command]
@="\"C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\ipython.exe\" \"notebook\" \"%V\""

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ipynb_auto_file\shell\open\command]
@="\"C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\ipython.exe\" \"notebook\" \"%1\""
```
