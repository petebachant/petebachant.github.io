Having used SolidWorks for a while, and likely entering the job market again in \\( O(1) \\) years, I was curious as to which CAD software would be wisest to learn next, with respect to job opportunities and salaries. Looking to compile data from the current job market, I wrote [Indeedy](https://github.com/petebachant/Indeedy), a Python module for automatically searching [Indeed.com](http://indeed.com). With this new tool I searched for "mechanical engineer" plus the names of various CAD systems, then plotted the number of results and average salary for each on the bar graph shown below.

From these results we can see demand for SolidWorks is dominant by a large margin. However, Catia and NX skills are compensated better on average, which makes sense considering their popularity in the aerospace and automotive industries. At first glance it seems there are more Catia than NX jobs, but when NX's results are combined with Unigraphics' (NX's ancestor), demand is comparable. However, this combination also comes with with a decrease in average salary, giving Catia a slight edge, and the title of _Best CAD System to Learn_ (for me anyway).
