Living in a studio apartment, storage space can be hard to come by. To have a place to store both my bike and hitch receiver bike rack, I designed and built a rolling stand that holds the rack upright, also serving as a nice work stand.

The frame is made from [80/20](https://8020.net) t-slot extrusions and hardware, which are available at Amazon.com. On top is a 2 inch Reese hitch receiver, and below is a set of swivel casters, two of which are locking. One nice feature of this design is that it only requires cutting and tappingâ€”no welding, drilling, or more complicated machining necessary before it's ready for assembly.

The SolidWorks 2012 CAD models for this assembly can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwMVIAlxIxfZQlp2T2xpRHhRd0E/edit?usp=sharing).
