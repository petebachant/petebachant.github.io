Undergrad thermodynamics was a bit of an
"I am 14 and this is deep"
moment for me.
The laws learned therein became a way to understand not just
systems of pumps, compressors, turbines, and heat exchangers,
but for life itself---a continuous flow of energy
and the never ending pursuit of the rejection of entropy.

I never learned economics in any academic sense,
but at one point wondered if the "laws" of economics---if there were such
a concept---obeyed the laws of physics.
Are our current economic policies consistent with thermodynamics?
Could currency be understood like a thermal fluid?
Here we're going to think about this a little bit.

First, let's lay out the analogy.
Imagine the economy is a bunch of pipes,
and money is water in those pipes.
The value of that money is represented by its temperature.
Analogous to the ability of heat to do work,
money has the ability to provide human wellbeing,
often as a literal energy exchange, e.g., eating food.

Now, we need to consider the 2nd law here.
The system is not totally insulated, so we'll always be losing energy.
This is like the deterioration of capital, e.g.,
a machine in a factory or a home needing periodic maintenance.

There are many heat exchangers taking value out of the system,
any many putting it in.

Money represents entitlement to mass and energy,
though most of the mass is not valuable without a bunch of
energy put into it.

Energy is the capacity to do work,
and by extension, the capacity to create human wellbeing.

However, not all energy is created equal.
For example, heat at a higher temperature has more potential to do work
than that at a lower temperature, in the same environment.

In this framework, what does GDP mean?

What is the role of regulators?
They should keep the temperature of the fluid constant,
or keep the buying power of money constant.

In this framework, how do we view money creation in
our current monetary system?
Banks are adding fluid to the system with the assumption that
heat will be added to it later.

What is an interest rate?

What is inflation in this analogy?

What is stimulus?

What if we could better track transactions that destroy exergy,
ones that despite money changing hands,
actually reduces the value.
One example could be buying a yacht.
Lots of resources are transformed and lots of energy is put in
to the process,
put into a machine that has no capacity to capture any more energy,
or produce other machinery.
