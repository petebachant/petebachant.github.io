Money represents entitlement to mass and energy,
though most of the mass is not valuable without a bunch of
energy put into it.

Energy is the capacity to do work,
and by extension, the capacity to create human wellbeing.

However, not all energy is created equal.
For example, heat at a higher temperature has more potential to do work
than that at a lower temperature, in the same environment.

In this framework, what does GDP mean?

What is the role of regulators?
They should keep the temperature of the fluid constant,
or keep the buying power of money constant.

In this framework, how do we view money creation in
our current monetary system?
Banks are adding fluid to the system with the assumption that
heat will be added to it later.

What is an interest rate?

What is inflation in this analogy?

What if we could better track transactions that destroy exergy,
ones that despite money changing hands,
actually reduces the value.
One example could be buying a yacht.
Lots of resources are transformed and lots of energy is put in
to the process,
put into a machine that has no capacity to capture any more energy,
or produce other machinery.
