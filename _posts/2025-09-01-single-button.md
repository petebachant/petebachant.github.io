I left my job about a year ago to try to help with the reproducibility
crisis.
This article is a summary of what I've learned so far and my current outlook.

## What is reproducibility

First off, what is reproducibility?
Not to be confused with replicability,

Single button

"Foundational" dependencies are an exception.
Things like package managers, Docker, etc.
Individual package installs must be automated though.

## The state of the art in open reproducible science

Lists in a README

A conflation of repro/reuse

## Why reproducibility is rare

Cost/benefit

Cost can be getting scooped

## Why we should improve

Eliminating mistakes: Let's forget about that because in peer review it's
hardly ever checked.
However, it's a given.

We are going to focus on benefits to the individual,
not society.

Efficiency gains

Iteration cycle time

Can we do a simulation to show where the tipping point is with simpy?

Reusability

## How we could improve

Maybe don't need this section

Bring down the cost and improve the benefit

Education is a cost
Can we reduce the amount of training required by building better
computational tooling and infrastructure?

If you look at the landscape, there are so many tools out there to use,
but it's very rare to tie them all together.
