I left my job about a year ago to try to help with the reproducibility
crisis.
This article is a summary of what I've learned so far and my current outlook.

## What is reproducibility

First off, what is reproducibility?
Not to be confused with replicability,

Single button

"Foundational" dependencies are an exception.
Things like package managers, Docker, etc.
Individual package installs must be automated though.

## The state of the art in open reproducible science

Lists in a README

A conflation of repro/reuse

## Why reproducibility is rare

Cost/benefit

Cost can be getting scooped

## Why we should improve

Eliminating mistakes: Let's forget about that because in peer review it's
hardly ever checked.
However, it's a given.

We are going to focus on benefits to the individual,
not society.

Efficiency gains

Iteration cycle time

Can we do a simulation to show where the tipping point is with simpy?

Reusability

A nice reproducible research project serves as a platform for doing more
science, not as a platform for developing software.

I often see repro packs written in such a way that they attempt to
deliver half-baked tools instead of the research project itself.
This may be out of humility.
Why would anyone want code that simply produces the results in my paper
but nothing more?

The thing is,
in trying to make your code more reusable you broke its ability to achieve
its original purpose!

## How we could improve

Maybe don't need this section

Bring down the cost and improve the benefit

Education is a cost
Can we reduce the amount of training required by building better
computational tooling and infrastructure?

If you look at the landscape, there are so many tools out there to use,
but it's very rare to tie them all together.
