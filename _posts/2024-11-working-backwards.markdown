title: "Thoughts on 'Working Backwards': The 5 hows"
categories:
- Product
---

You may have heard of the "five whys" as a method to truly understand a
problem and ensure you have the right solution.

I would like to propose the "five hows" as a way to work backwards.

As a manager I have been guilty of giving direction too far left on the
output--outcome spectrum.

The five whys can get you from feature factory to empowered team.
The five hows can get you from outcomes to solutions.

I think there were some things that are contradictory: We focus on input
metrics not output metrics.

This is confusing, but I think they are actually talking about outcomes
not outputs.

Marty Cagan cites Amazon as a top product company that employs the
"product operating model".

Input metrics: product outcomes (user behavior)
Output metrics: business outcomes (revenue)

Theresa Torres masterclass with Scandinavian product guy.

Neither of these are features.

Example of Jeff Bezos saying: Create a subscription shipping program.

Is that a solution or a strategy?

Are the teams really empowered to discover what will keep customers around,
or were they told to create a solution?
