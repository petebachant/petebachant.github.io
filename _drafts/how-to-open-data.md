title: How to open data

In this post I will describe the methods I prefer for sharing research data in an open way. I make no claims that this is the correct or optimal strategy, but it works for my pusposes. 

First, the guiding principles. A good data sharing strategy should be:



    
  1. Useful
    
  2. Persistent
    
  3. Maintainable
    
  4. Collaborative




##  1. Use open tools 



Avoid closed-source proprietary software, e.g. MATLAB, unless absolutely necessary. This will prevent financial barriers to using the work. Instead, you can use Python.



##  2. Include the code 



Code and data belong together. That is, the code used to process the data and create any visualization should come with the data. 



##  3. Use version control 





##  4. Use someone else's hosting 



There are general repositories that allow free hosting of open data. Many of these will mint digital object identifiers (DOIs), which provide a persistent location and the means to cite your code/data. This can help relieve IT resources at your institution. These people know what they are doing!

Why not just use Dropbox, Google Drive? -- You need to keep that data there forever, taking up your space. Assuming you will keep doing more research, you may run out of space.
