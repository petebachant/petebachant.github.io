Fitting the B3.3 in the Explorer was tough. Even with a body lift, the turbo was way too high. To move it down, the intake and exhaust had to be modified. Cutting down and welding the intake was easy enough, but the exhaust was a bit trickier. It wasn't possible to simply flip the OEM exhaust manifold over, so a custom exhaust header was in order.

Rather than use ad hoc methods as in previous exhaust projects, I wanted to design this from scratch, using 3-D CAD, and fabricate to the designâ€”a process that takes more time up front, but is way worth it in my opinion.

Design was easy enough. Measurements were taken with the engine mocked up such that the relative positions of the head and turbine flanges could be identified. These were easy to fix in the appropriate coordinate system in the CAD assembly. Next, lofted solids were created to transition from the rectangular exhaust ports to the circular tubing. Since the bent sections would be made from tube elbows, these were brought into the assembly as necessary. Combined with straight sections, tubes were run into each other and eventually two tubes met at the turbine flange. Swept cuts were then made to cope all the pieces in the assembly.

Next, since the fabrication was to be done by hand with a cutoff wheel, patterns for coping needed to be made. SolidWorks sheet metal tools were used to unwrap the cut pieces, from which flat pattern drawings were made, then wrapped around the tubes for marking. However, the original parts were not sheet metal, and could not be easily converted, so they had to be remodeled as sheet metal. It would have been smarter to start with sheet metal, but it still got the job done.
