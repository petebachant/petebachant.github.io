It's interesting and a little embarrassing that I never really understood what science was until I was 20 or so, and I didn't pick it up in school. Maybe it was never explained like it is in the video below, or maybe I just wasn't paying attention or thinking hard enough. I like to hope I was the minority, but I have a feeling a lot more people made it through school without ever learning science either. That would be bad.
